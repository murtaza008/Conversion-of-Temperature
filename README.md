# Conversion-of-Temperature
Conversion of Temperature(Fahrenheit to Celsius/Kelvin, Celsius to Fahrenheit/Kelvin, Kelvin to Fahrenheit/Celsius) using C++ programming Language


I made a C++ program from which you can convert the scales of temperature like from kelvin to fahrenheit/celsius, celsius to kelvin/fahrenheit or fahrenheit to celsius/kelvin.


In the starting of the main function i applied while(true) loop which will run infinity times.


Then i declared variables value, fahrenheit, celsius and kelvin. The value variable is used to take input from the user in which the user write the value of the temperature.


Then i declared variables basicUnit and conversionUnit. The basic unit is used to insert from the user that the value is in which scale of temperature. The conversionUnit is used to insert from the user in which scale of the temperature you want to change the value.


Then i prompt the user to enter the value.


Then i prompt the user to enter the basic unit c for celsius, k for kelvin and f for fahrenheit.


Then i prompt the user to enter the conversion unit c for celsius, k for kelvin and f for fahrenheit.


Then i applied checker that what basic unit did the user choose.


Whichever basic unit the user choose the value will be assigned to that basic unit scale.


Then there are checkers for the conversion unit.


Whichever conversion unit the user choose the value will change to the conversion unit scale as I have applied formula in every checker.


Then the program will display the value which came after the conversion of scale.


If the user inputs invalid option then the program will display invalid input.


Furthermore, I have added comments in the program which helps the user to understand the code more easily.
